Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Dracula,

I am writing to you from a fluffy spaceship in a tasty galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a [4] rocket in May. There are 14 puppies and [8] of pumpkins here! In the
bathroom there is a pool full of coffee. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
candy and dream of hiking carefully. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] centuries. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
petting a cat on a important [20]!!

Best wishes,
Twelve
